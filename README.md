Google Earth hacks
==================

Requirements:
-------------
Jawin - to interact with native com components  - http://jawinproject.sourceforge.net/jawin.html <br/>
Jak - generate kml - http://labs.micromata.de/projects/jak/quickstart.html <br/>

========
For embedding GE, Jawin comes handy.The stubs (com/tckb/ge/stubs) generated from it is used interacting with the Google Earth's COM API. For now, the controls are a bit fuzzy but, I will try to fix it soon. 
 
Have fun! <br/>

NB:
This hack is inspired from the presentation by Rob ratcliff. Original presentation can be found at http://www.austinjug.org/presentations/GoogleEarthHacks.pdf. Although, much of the code has been done to suit the hack, the project contains parts of code from him.
