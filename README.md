Google earth hacks
==================
Embeding Google earth on to a Java Frame. Jawin comes handy for interacting with the Google Earth's COM API. The stubs for the com api generated from the Jawin are located at com/tckb/ge/stubs 

Requirements:
-------------
Jawin - to interact with native com components  - http://jawinproject.sourceforge.net/jawin.html <br/>
Jak - generate kml - http://labs.micromata.de/projects/jak/quickstart.html <br/>


















NB:
This hack is inspired from the presentation by Rob ratcliff. Original presentation can be found at http://www.austinjug.org/presentations/GoogleEarthHacks.pdf. Although, much of the code has been done to suit the hack, the project contains parts of code from him.
